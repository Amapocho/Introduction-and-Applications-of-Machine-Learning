# Introduction-and-Applications-of-Machine-Learning

Instructors: Shreyas Bhat, S I Harini, Rishav Mukherji <br>
Mentors: Hardik Shah

## Course Description and Outcome

The course intends to help students with no experience in machine learning take their first steps in the field. We will start off with the basic Machine learning theory and look into essential tools needed for ML; libraries like numpy and pandas. Then we will proceed to teach the students about various machine learning algorithms, the maths behind it. With the help of scikit learn, the students will learn how to implement various models as well. 

In the fourth week we intend to introduce the students to Deep Learning and how to implement perceptrons and neural networks in Pytorch followed by a basic introduction to CV in the last week and subsequent project completion.
